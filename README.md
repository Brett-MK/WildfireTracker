# WildfireTracker
A React app that tracks all wildfires across the world using NASA's satellite information API.

This application is deployed to https://agitated-shannon-3e5bcf.netlify.app/.

If this repo is cloned, get rid of the development google map by supplying a google map API key of name REACT_APP_MAPS_API_KEY as an environment variable.
